This is the repository for my personal website!

Built using the [Academic theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/) for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the [blogdown package](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) for RMarkdown, and deployed using [Netlify](netlify.com).

[Alison Hill's tutorial](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/) for getting up and running using blogdown was an invaluable resource for learning to create this site.

WIP: Currently migrating this site to Quarto.
